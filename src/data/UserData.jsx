  about :   `Hi, I’m Md Mostakim Hosen, a frontend developer with a passion for clean code and creative design. My journey in programming started with curiosity, and over time, it became something I truly love. I enjoy building responsive, user-friendly interfaces using technologies like React.js, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.

I love solving real-world problems through code and turning ideas into functional web applications. Whether it’s a simple landing page or a dynamic user dashboard, I always focus on performance, design, and user experience.

Outside of coding, I enjoy music, especially emotional songs, watching football, and spending time with my thoughts. I also dream of becoming a teacher — someone who can inspire and guide the next generation.

Let’s build something meaningful together!`,
